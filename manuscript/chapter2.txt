# Controllers
Controllers in Angular provide the business logic to handle view behaviour, for example responding to a user clicking a button or entering some text in a form. Additionally controllers prepare the model for the view template.

As a general rule a controller should not reference or manipulate the DOM directly. This has the benefit of simplifying unit testing controllers.

## Assigning a Default Value to a Model

### Problem
You want to assign a default value to the scope in the controllers context.

### Solution
Use the `ng-controller` directive in your template:

    <div ng-controller="MyCtrl">
      <p>{{value}}</p>
    </div>

Next, define the scope variable in your controller function:

    var MyCtrl = function($scope) {
      $scope.value = "some value";
    };

### Discussion
Depending on where you use the ng-controller directive, you define its assigned scope. The scope is hierachical and follows the DOM node hierarchy. In our example the value expression is correctly evaluated to `some value`, since value is set in the `MyCtrl` controller. Note, that this would not work if the value expression is moved outside the controllers scope:

    <p>{{value}}</p>

    <div ng-controller="MyCtrl">
    </div>

In this case `{{value}}` will simply be not rendered at all due to the fact that expression evaluation in Angular.js is forgiving for `undefined` and `null` values.

## Changing a Model Value with a Controller Function

### Problem
You want to increment a model value by 1 using a controller function.

### Solution
Implement an increment function which changes the scope.

    function MyCtrl($scope) {
      $scope.value = 1;

      $scope.incrementValue = function(value) {
        $scope.value += 1;
      };
    }

This function can be directly called in an expression, in our example we use `ng-init`:

    <div ng-controller="MyCtrl">
      <p ng-init="incrementValue(5)">{{value}}</p>
    </div>

### Discussion
The `ng-init` directive is executed on page load and calls the function `incrementValue` defined in `MyCtrl`. Functions are defined on the scope very similar to values but must be called with the familiar parenthesis syntax.

Of course, it would have been possible to increment the value right inside of the expression with `value = value +1` but imagine the function being much more complex! Moving this function into a controller separates our business logic from our declarative view template and we can easily write unit tests for it.

## Encapsulating a Model Value with a Controller Function

### Problem
You want to retrieve a model via function (instead of directly accessing the scope from the template) which encapsulates the model value.

### Solution
Define a getter function which returns the model value.

    function MyCtrl($scope) {
      $scope.value = 1;

      $scope.getIncrementedValue = function() {
        return $scope.value + 1;
      };
    }

Then in the template we use an expression to call it:

    <div ng-controller="MyCtrl">
      <p>{{getIncrementedValue()}}</p>
    </div>

### Discussion
`MyCtrl` defines the `getIncrementedValue` function which uses the current value and returns it incremented by one. One could argue that depending on the use case it would make more sense to use a filter. But, there are use cases specific to the controllers behaviour where you do not require a generic filter.

## Responding to Scope Changes

### Problem
You want to react on a model change to trigger some further actions. In our example we simple want to set another model value depending on the value we are listening on.

### Solution
Use the `$watch` function in your controller.

    function MyCtrl($scope) {
      $scope.name = "";

      $scope.$watch("name", function(newValue, oldValue) {
        if ($scope.name.length > 0) {
          $scope.greeting = "Greetings " + $scope.name;
        }
      });
    }

In our example we use the text input value to print a friendly gretting.

    <div ng-controller="MyCtrl">
      <input type="text" ng-model="name" placeholder="Enter your name">
      <p>{{greeting}}</p>
    </div>

The value `greeting` will be changed whenever there's a change on the `name` model and the value is not blank.

### Discussion
The first argument `name` of the `$watch` function is actually an Angular expression, so you can use more complicated expressions (for example: `[value1, value2] | json`) or even a javascript function. In this case you need to return a String in the watcher function:

    $scope.$watch(function() {
      return $scope.name;
    }, function(newValue, oldValue) {
      console.log("change detected: " + newValue)
    });

The second argument is a function which gets called whenever the expression evaluation returns a different value. The first parameter is the new value and the second parameter the old value. Internally this uses `angular.equals` to determine equality which means both objects or values pass the `===` comparison.

## Sharing Models Between Nested Controllers

### Problem
You want to share a model between a nested hierarchy of controllers.

### Solution
Use javascript objects instead of primitives or direct `$parent` scope references.

Our example template uses a controller `MyCtrl` and a nested controller `MyNestedCtrl`:

    <body ng-app="MyApp">
      <div ng-controller="MyCtrl">
        <label>Primitive</label>
        <input type="text" ng-model="name">

        <label>Object</label>
        <input type="text" ng-model="user.name">

        <div class="nested" ng-controller="MyNestedCtrl">
          <label>Primitive</label>
          <input type="text" ng-model="name">

          <label>Primitive with explicit $parent reference</label>
          <input type="text" ng-model="$parent.name">

          <label>Object</label>
          <input type="text" ng-model="user.name">
        </div>
      </div>
    </body>

The `app.js` file contains the controller definition and initializes the scope with some defaults:

    var app = angular.module("MyApp", []);

    app.controller("MyCtrl", function($scope) {
      $scope.name = "Peter";
      $scope.user = {
        name: "Parker"
      };
    });

    app.controller("MyNestedCtrl", function($scope) {
    });

Play around with the various input fields and check how changes affect each other.

### Discussion
All the default values are defined in `MyCtrl` which is the parent of `MyNestedCtrl`. When doing changes in the first input field, the changes will be in sync with the other input fields bound to the `name` variable. They all share the same scope variable as long as they only read from the variable. If you change the nested value, a copy in the scope of the `MyNestedCtrl` will be created. From now on, changing the first input field will only change the nested input field which explicitly references the parent scope via `$parent.name` expression.

The object based value behaves differently in this regard. Wether you change the nested or the `MyCtrl` scopes input fields, the changes will stay in sync. In Angular a scope prototypically inherits properties from a parent scope. Objects are therefore references and kept in sync. Whereas primitive types are only in sync as long they are not changed in the child scope.

Generally I tend to not use `$parent.name` and instead always use objects to share model properties. If you use `$parent.name` the `MyNestedCtrl` not only requires certain model attributes but also a correct scope hierachy to work with.

T> Tip: The Chrome plugin [Batarang](https://github.com/angular/angularjs-batarang) simplifies debugging the scope hierarchy by showing you a tree of the nested scopes. It is awesome!

## Sharing Code Between Controllers using Services

### Problem
You want to share business logic between controllers.

### Solution
Use a [Service](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.services) to implement your business logic and use dependency injection to use this service in your controllers.

The template shows access to a list of users from two controllers:

    <div ng-controller="MyCtrl">
      <ul ng-repeat="user in users">
        <li>{{user}}</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="nested" ng-controller="AnotherCtrl">
        First user: {{firstUser}}
      </div>
    </div>

The service and controller implementation in `app.js` implements a user service and the controllers set the scope initially:

    var app = angular.module("MyApp", []);

    app.factory("UserService", function() {
      var users = ["Peter", "Daniel", "Nina"];

      return {
        all: function() {
          return users;
        },
        first: function() {
          return users[0];
        }
      };
    });

    app.controller("MyCtrl", function($scope, UserService) {
      $scope.users = UserService.all();
    });

    app.controller("AnotherCtrl", function($scope, UserService) {
      $scope.firstUser = UserService.first();
    });

### Discussion
The `factory` method creates a singleton `UserService` which returns two functions for retrieving all users and the first user only. The controllers get the `UserService` injected by adding it to the `controller` function as params.

Using dependency injection here is quite nice for testing your controllers, since you can inject a `UserService` stub easily. The only downside is that you can't minify the code from above without breaking it, since the injection mechanism relies on the exact String representation of `UserService`. It is therefore recommended to define dependencies using inline annotations, which keeps working even when minified:

    app.controller("AnotherCtrl", ["$scope", "UserService", function($scope, UserService) {
      $scope.firstUser = UserService.first();
    }]);

The syntax looks a bit funny, but since Strings in Arrays are not changed during the minification it solves our problem. Note, that you could change the parameter names of the function, since the injection mechanism relies on the order of the Array definition only.

Another way to achieve the same is using the `$inject` annotation:

    var anotherCtrl = function($scope, UserService) {
      $scope.firstUser = UserService.first();
    };

    anotherCtrl.$inject = ["$scope", "UserService"];

This requires you to use a temporary variable to call the `$inject` service. Again, you could change the function parameter names. You will most probably see both versions applied in apps using Angular.

## Testing Controllers

### Problem
You want to unit test your business logic.

### Solution
Implement a unit test using [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and the [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) project. Following our previous `$watch` recipe this is how our spec would look like.

    describe('MyCtrl', function(){
      var scope, ctrl;

      beforeEach(inject(function($injector, $controller, $rootScope) {
        scope = $rootScope.$new();
        ctrl = $controller(MyCtrl, { $scope: scope });
      }));

      it('should change greeting value if name value is changed', function() {
        scope.name = "Frederik";
        scope.$digest();
        expect(scope.greeting).toBe("Greetings Frederik");
      });
    });


### Discussion
Jasmine specs use `describe` and `it` functions to group specs and `beforeEach` and `afterEach` to setup and teardown code. The actual expectation compares the greeting from the scope with our expectation `Greetings Frederik`.

The scope and controller initialization is a bit more involved. We use `inject` to initialize the scope and controller as closely as possible to how our code would behave at runtime too. We can't just initialize the scope as an javascript object `{}` since then we would not be able to call `$watch` on it. Instead `$rootScope.$new()` will do the trick. Note, that the `$controller` service requires `MyCtrl` to be available and uses an object notation to pass in dependencies.

The `$digest` call is required in order to trigger a watch execution after we changed the scope. We need to call `$digest` manually in our spec whereas at runtime Angular will do this for us automatically.
