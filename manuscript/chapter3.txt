# Directives
Directives are one of the most powerful concepts in Angular since they let you invent new html syntax specific to your application. This allows you to create reusable components which encapsulate complex DOM structures, stylesheets and even behaviour. 

## Enable/Disable DOM element conditionally

### Problem
You want to disable a button depending on a checkbox state.

### Solution
Use the `ng-disabled` directive and bind its condition to the checkbox state.

    <body ng-app>
      <label><input type="checkbox" ng-model="checked"/>Toggle Button</label>
      <button ng-disabled="checked">Press me</button>
    </body>

### Discussion
The `ng-disabled` directive is a direct translation from the disabled HTML attribute, without you needing to worry about browser incompatibilities. It is bound to the `checked` model using an attribute value as is the checkbox using the `ng-model` directive. In fact the `checked` attribute value is again an Angular expression. You could for example invert the logic and use `!checked` instead.

This is just one example of a directive shipped with Angular. There are many others as for example `ng-hide`, `ng-checked` or `ng-mouseenter` and I encourage you go through the [API Reference](http://docs.angularjs.org/api) and explore all the directives Angular has to offer. 

In the next recipes we will focus on implementing directives.

## Implement DOM changes in response to user behaviour

### Problem
You want to change the css of an HTML element on a mouse click and encapsulate this behaviour in a reusable component.

### Solution
Implement a directive with defines a link function.

    <body ng-app="MyApp">
      <my-widget>
        <p>Hello World</p>
      </my-widget>
    </body>


    var app = angular.module("MyApp", []);

    app.directive("myWidget", function() {
      var linkFunction = function(scope, element, attributes) {
        var paragraph = element.children()[0];
        $(paragraph).on("click", function() {
          $(this).css({ "background-color": "red" });
        });
      };

      return {
        restrict: "E",
        link: linkFunction
      };
    });

When clicking on the paragraph the background color changes to red.

### Discussion
In the HTML document we use the new directive as an HTML element `my-widget`, which can be found in the javascript code as `myWidget` again. The directive function returns a restriction and a link function. 

The restriction means that this directive can only be used as an HTML element and not for example an HTML attribute. If you want to use it as an HTML attribute, change the `restrict` to return `A` instead. The usage would then have to be adapted to:

    <div my-widget>
      <p>Hello World</p>
    </div>

Wether you use the attribute or element mechanism depends on your use case. Generally speaking one would use the element mechanism to define a custom reusable component. The attribute mechanism would be used whenever you want to "configure" some element or enhance it with more behaviour. Other options are using the directive as a class attribute or a comment. 

The link function is much more interesting since it defines the actual behaviour. The scope, the actual HTML element `my-widget` and the html attributes are passed as params. Note, that this has nothing to do with Angulars dependency injection mechanism. Ordering of the parameters is important!

First we select the paragraph element, which is a child of the `my-widget` element using Angulars `children()` function as defined by element. In the second step we use jQuery to bind to the click event and modify the css property on click. This is of special interest since we have a mixture of Angular element functions and jQuery here. In fact under the hood Angular will use jQuery in the `children()` function if its defined and will fall back to jqLite (shipped with Angular) otherwise. You can find all supported methods in the [API Reference of element](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/angular.element).

Following a slightly changed version of the code using jQuery only:

    element.on("click", function() {
      $(this).css({ "background-color": "red" });
    });

In this case `element` is alreay an jQuery element and we can directly use the on function.

The `directive` method expects a function which can be used for initialization and injection of dependencies.

    app.directive("myWidget", function factory(injectables) {
      // ...
    }

## Render an html snippet

### Problem
You want to render a html snippet in multiple places

### Solution
Implement a directive and use the template attribute to define the HTML.

    <body ng-app="MyApp">
      <my-widget/>
    </body>

    var app = angular.module("MyApp", []);

    app.directive("myWidget", function() {
      return {
        restrict: "E",
        template: "<p>Hello World</p>"
      };
    });

### Discussion
This will render the Hello World paragraph as a child node of your `my-widget` element. In case you want to replace the element entirely with the paragraph you have to additionally return the replace attribute:

    app.directive("myWidget", function() {
      return {
        restrict: "E",
        replace: true,
        template: "<p>Hello World</p>"
      };
    });

Another option would be to use a file for the HTML snippet. In this case you need to use the templateUrl attribute, as for example:
  
    app.directive("myWidget", function() {
      return {
        restrict: "E",
        replace: true,
        templateUrl: "widget.html"
      };
    });

The `widget.html` should reside in the same directory as the `index.html` file. This will only work if you use a web server to host the file. The example on Github uses angular-seed as bootstrap again.

## Use directives child nodes in directive output

### Problem
Your widget uses the child nodes of the directive element to create a combined rendering.

### Solution
Use the `transclude` attribute together with the `ng-transclude` directive.

    <my-widget>
      <p>This is my paragraph text.</p>
    </my-widget>

    var app = angular.module("MyApp", []);

    app.directive("myWidget", function() {
      return {
        restrict: "E",
        transclude: true,
        template: "<div ng-transclude><h3>Heading</h3></div>"
      };
    });

This will render a `div` element containing a `h3` element and append the directives child node with the paragraph element below.

### Discussion 
In this context transclusion refers to the inclusion of a part of a document into another document by reference. The `ng-transclude` attribute should be placed depending on where you want your child nodes to be appended to.

## Pass configuration params using HTML attributes

### Problem
You want to pass a configuration param to change the rendered output.

### Solution
Use the attribute based directive and pass an attribute value for the configuration. The attribute is passed as a parameter to the link function.

    <body ng-app="MyApp">
      <div my-widget="Hello World"></div>
    </body>

    var app = angular.module("MyApp", []);

    app.directive("myWidget", function() {
      var linkFunction = function(scope, element, attributes) {
        scope.text = attributes["myWidget"];
      };

      return {
        restrict: "A",
        template: "<p>{{text}}</p>",
        link: linkFunction
      };
    });


### Discussion
The link function has access to the element and its attributes. It is therefore straight forward to set the scope to the text passed as the attributes value and use this in the template evaluation.

The scope context is important though. The `text` model we changed might be already defined in the parent scope and used in another place of your app. In order to isolate the context and thereby using it only locally inside of your directive we have to return an additional scope attribute.

    return {
      restrict: "A",
      template: "<p>{{text}}</p>",
      link: linkFunction,
      scope: {}
    };

In Angular this is called an isolate scope. It does not prototypically inherit from the parent scope and is especially useful when creating reusable components.

Lets look into another way of passing params to the directive, this time we define an HTML element `my-widget`.

    <my-widget2 text="Hello World"></my-widget2>

    app.directive("myWidget2", function() {
      return {
        restrict: "E",
        template: "<p>{{text}}</p>",
        scope: {
          text: "@text"
        }
      };
    });

The scope definition using `@text` is binding the text model to the directive's attribute. Note, that any changes on the parent scope `text` will change the local scope `text`, but not the other way around

If you want instead to have a bi-directional binding between the parent scope and the local scope, you should use the `=` equality character:

    scope: {
      text: "=text"
    }

Changes to the local scope will also change the parent scope.

Another possibility would be to pass an expression as a function to the directive using the `&` character.

    <my-widget-expr fn="count = count + 1"></my-widget-expr>

    app.directive("myWidgetExpr", function() {
      var linkFunction = function(scope, element, attributes) {
        scope.text = scope.fn({ count: 5 });
      };

      return {
        restrict: "E",
        template: "<p>{{text}}</p>",
        link: linkFunction,
        scope: {
          fn: "&fn"
        }
      };
    });

We pass the attribute `fn` to the directive and since the local scope defines `fn` accordingly we can call the function in the linkFunction and pass in the expression arguments as a hash.

## Render an HTML snippet repeatedly

### Problem
You want to render an html snippet repeatedly using the directives child nodes as the "stamp" content.

### Solution
Implement a compile function in your directive.
    
    <repeat-ntimes repeat="10">
      <h1>Header 1</h1>
      <p>This is the paragraph.</p>
    </repeat-n-times>

    var app = angular.module("MyApp", []);

    app.directive("repeatNtimes", function() {
      return {
        restrict: "E",
        compile: function(tElement, attrs) {
          var content = tElement.children();
          for (var i=1; i<attrs.repeat; i++) {
            tElement.append(content.clone());
          }
        }
      };
    });

This will render the header and paragraph 10 times.

### Discussion
The directive repeats the child nodes as often as configured in the `repeat` attribute. It works similarly to the [ng-repeat](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngRepeat) directive. The implemention uses Angulars element methods to append the child nodes in a for loop.

Note, that the compile method only has access to the templates element (tElement) and template attributes. It has no access to the scope and you therefore also can't use `$watch` to add behaviour. This is in comparison to the link function which has access to the DOM "instance" (after the compile phase) and has access to the scope to add behaviour.

Use the compile function for template DOM manipulation only. Use the link function when you want to add behaviour.

Note, that you can use both compile and link function combined. In this case the compile function must return the link function. As an example you want to react to a click on the header:

    compile: function(tElement, attrs) {
      var content = tElement.children();
      for (var i=1; i<attrs.repeat; i++) {
        tElement.append(content.clone());
      }

      return function (scope, element, attrs) {
        element.on("click", "h1", function() {
          $(this).css({ "background-color": "red" });
        });
      };
    }


## Directive to directive communication

### Problem
You want a directive to communicate with another directive and augment each other's behaviour using a well defined interface (API).

### Solution
Implement a directive with a controller function and a second directive which "requires" this controller.

    <body ng-app="MyApp">
      <basket apple orange>Roll over me and check the console!</basket>
    </body>

    var app = angular.module("MyApp", []);

    app.directive("basket", function() {
      return {
        restrict: "E",
        controller: function($scope, $element, $attrs) {
          $scope.content = [];

          this.addApple = function() {
            $scope.content.push("apple");
          };

          this.addOrange = function() {
            $scope.content.push("orange");
          };
        },
        link: function(scope, element) {
          element.bind("mouseenter", function() {
            console.log(scope.content);
          });
        }
      };
    });

    app.directive("apple", function() {
      return {
        require: "basket",
        link: function(scope, element, attrs, basketCtrl) {
          basketCtrl.addApple();
        }
      };
    });

    app.directive("orange", function() {
      return {
        require: "basket",
        link: function(scope, element, attrs, basketCtrl) {
          basketCtrl.addOrange();
        }
      };
    });

If you hover with the mouse over the rendered text the console should print and the basket's content.

### Discussion
`Basket` is the example directive which demonstrates an API using the controller function, whereas the `apple` and `orange` directives augment the `Basket` directive. They both define a dependency to the `basket` controller with the `require` attribute. The link function then gets `basketCtrl` injected. 

Note, how the `basket` directive is defined as an HTML element and the `apple` and `orange` directives are defined as HTML attributes (the default for directives). This demonstrates the typical use case of a reusable component augmented by other directives. 

Now there might be other ways of passing data back and forth between directives - we have seen the different semantics of using the (isolated) context in directives in previous recipes - but what's especially great about the controller is the clear API contract it lets you define. 

## Testing directives

### Problem
You want to test your directive with a unit test. As an example we use a tab component directive implementation which can be easily used in your HTML document.

    <tabs>
      <pane title="First Tab">First pane.</pane>
      <pane title="Second Tab">Second pane.</pane>
    </tabs>

The directive implementation is split into the tabs and the pane directive. Let us start with the tabs directive.

    app.directive("tabs", function() {
      return {
        restrict: "E",
        transclude: true,
        scope: {},
        controller: function($scope, $element) {
          var panes = $scope.panes = [];

          $scope.select = function(pane) {
            angular.forEach(panes, function(pane) {
              pane.selected = false;
            });
            pane.selected = true;
            console.log("selected pane: ", pane.title);
          };

          this.addPane = function(pane) {
            if (!panes.length) $scope.select(pane);
            panes.push(pane);
          };
        },
        template:
          '<div class="tabbable">' +
            '<ul class="nav nav-tabs">' +
              '<li ng-repeat="pane in panes" ng-class="{active:pane.selected}">'+
                '<a href="" ng-click="select(pane)">{{pane.title}}</a>' +
              '</li>' +
            '</ul>' +
            '<div class="tab-content" ng-transclude></div>' +
          '</div>',
        replace: true
      };
    });

It manages a list of `panes` and the selected state of the `panes`. The template definition makes use of the selection to change the class and responds on the click event to change the selection. 

The `pane` directive depends on the `tabs` directive to add itself to it.

    app.directive("pane", function() {
      return {
        require: "^tabs",
        restrict: "E",
        transclude: true,
        scope: {
          title: "@"
        },
        link: function(scope, element, attrs, tabsCtrl) {
          tabsCtrl.addPane(scope);
        },
        template: '<div class="tab-pane" ng-class="{active: selected}" ng-transclude></div>',
        replace: true
      };
    });

### Solution
Using the angular-seed in combination with jasmine and jasmine-jquery you can implement a unit test.

    describe('MyApp Tabs', function() {
      var elm, scope;

      beforeEach(module('MyApp'));

      beforeEach(inject(function($rootScope, $compile) {
        elm = angular.element(
          '<div>' +
            '<tabs>' +
              '<pane title="First Tab">' +
                'First content is {{first}}' +
              '</pane>' +
              '<pane title="Second Tab">' +
                'Second content is {{second}}' +
              '</pane>' +
            '</tabs>' +
          '</div>');

        scope = $rootScope;
        $compile(elm)(scope);
        scope.$digest();
      }));

      it('should create clickable titles', function() {
        console.log(elm.find('ul.nav-tabs'));
        var titles = elm.find('ul.nav-tabs li a');

        expect(titles.length).toBe(2);
        expect(titles.eq(0).text()).toBe('First Tab');
        expect(titles.eq(1).text()).toBe('Second Tab');
      });

      it('should set active class on title', function() {
        var titles = elm.find('ul.nav-tabs li');

        expect(titles.eq(0)).toHaveClass('active');
        expect(titles.eq(1)).not.toHaveClass('active');
      });

      it('should change active pane when title clicked', function() {
        var titles = elm.find('ul.nav-tabs li');
        var contents = elm.find('div.tab-content div.tab-pane');

        titles.eq(1).find('a').click();

        expect(titles.eq(0)).not.toHaveClass('active');
        expect(titles.eq(1)).toHaveClass('active');

        expect(contents.eq(0)).not.toHaveClass('active');
        expect(contents.eq(1)).toHaveClass('active');
      });
    });

### Discussion
Combining jasmine with jasmine-jquery gives you useful assertions like `toHaveClass` and actions like `click` which are used extensively in the example above. 

To prepare the template we use `$compile` and `$digest` in the `beforeEach` function and then access the resulting Angular element in our tests.

The angular-seed project was slightly extended to add jquery and jasmine-jquery to the project.

The example code was extracted from [Vojta Jina' Github example](https://github.com/vojtajina/ng-directive-testing/tree/start) - the author of the awesome [Testacular](https://github.com/testacular/testacular).
