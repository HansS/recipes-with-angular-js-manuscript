# Preface

## Introduction
Angular.js is an open-source Javascript MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework developed by Google. It gives Javascript developers a highly structured approach to developing rich browser-based applications which leads to very high productivity.

If you are using Angular.js, or considering it, this cookbook provides easy to follow recipes for issues you are likely to face. Each recipe solves a specific problem and provides a solution and in-depth discussion of it.

## Code Examples
All code examples in this book can be found on [Github](http://github.com/fdietz/recipes-with-angular-js-examples).
