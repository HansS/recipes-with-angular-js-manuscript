# Preface

## Introduction
Angular.js 1.0 has been released only half a year ago but is already changing the development status quo of client-side web apps. With its focus on CRUD based applications it achieves a very high productivity unmatched by other frameworks. If you are using Angular.js, or considering it, this cookbook provides easy to follow recipes for issues you are likely to face.

Each recipe solves a specific problem and provides a solution and in-depth discussion of it.

## Why Angular.js?

## Code Examples
