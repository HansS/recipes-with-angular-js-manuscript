# Backend Integration with Ruby on Rails
In this chapter we will have a look into solving common problems when combining Angular.js with the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) frameworks. The examples used in this chapter are based on a Contacts app to manage a list of contacts.

## Consuming REST APIs

### Problem
You want to consume a JSON REST API in your Angular.js app.

### Solution
Using the `$resource` service is a great start and can be tweaked to feel more natural to a Rails developer by configuring the methods in accordance to the Rails actions.

    app.factory("Contact", function($resource) {
      return $resource("/api/contacts/:id", { id: "@id" },
        {
          'create':  { method: 'POST' },
          'index':   { method: 'GET', isArray: true },
          'show':    { method: 'GET', isArray: false },
          'update':  { method: 'PUT' },
          'destroy': { method: 'DELETE' }
        }
      );
    });

We can now fetch a list of contacts using `Contact.index()` and a single contact with `Contact.show(id)`. These actions can be directly mapped to the `ContactsController` actions in the backend.

    class ContactsController < ApplicationController
      respond_to :json

      def index
        @contacts = Contact.all
        respond_with @contacts
      end

      def show
        @contact = Contact.find(params[:id])
        respond_with @contact
      end

      ...
    end

The controller uses a `Contact` ActiveRecord model with the usual contact attributes like firstname, lastname, age, etc. By specifying `respond_to :json` the controller only responds to the JSON resource format and we can use `respond_with` to automatically transform the `Contact` model to a JSON response.

The route definition uses the Rails default resource routing and an `api` scope to separate the API requests from other requests.

    Contacts::Application.routes.draw do
      scope "api" do
        resources :contacts
      end
    end

This will generate paths as for example `api/contacts` and `api/contacts/:id` for the HTTP GET method.

### Discussion

This works nicely until we use the HTTP methods `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` with the resource. As a security mechanism Rails expects an authenticity token to prevent a CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) attack. We need  to submit an additional HTTP header `X-CSRF-Token` with the token as defined via the HTML `meta` tag `csrf-token`. Using jQuery we can fetch that meta tag definition and configure the `$httpProvider` appropriately.

    var app = angular.module("Contacts", ["ngResource"]);
    app.config(function($httpProvider) {
      $httpProvider.defaults.headers.common['X-CSRF-Token'] = $('meta[name=csrf-token]').attr('content');
    });

If you are using a Rails version prior 3.1 you'll notice that the JSON response will use a `contact` namespace for the model attributes which breaks your Angular.js code. To disable this behaviour you can configure your Rails app accordingly.

    ActiveRecord::Base.include_root_in_json = false

There are still inconsistencies between the Ruby and Javascript world. For example in Ruby we use underscored attribute names (display_name) whereas in Javascript we use camelCase (displayName).

There is a custom `$resource` implementation [angularjs-rails-resource](https://github.com/tpodom/angularjs-rails-resource) available to streamline consuming Rails resources. It uses transformers and inceptors to rename the attribute fields and handles the root wrapping behaviour for you.

## Implementing Client-Side Routing

### Problem
You want to use client-side routing in conjunction with a Ruby on Rails backend.

### Solution
Every request to the backend should initially render the complete layout in order to load our Angular app. Only then the client-side rendering will take over. Let us first have a look at the route definition for this "catch all" route.

    Contacts::Application.routes.draw do
      root :to => "layouts#index"
      match "*path" => "layouts#index"
    end

It uses [Route Globbing](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#route-globbing) to match all URLs and defines a root URL. Both will be handled by a layout controller with the sole purpose to render the initial layout.

    class LayoutsController < ApplicationController
      def index
        render "layouts/application"
      end
    end

The actual layout template defines our `ng-view` directive and resides in `app/views/layouts/application.html` - nothing new here. So, lets skip ahead to the Angular route definition in `app.js.erb`.

    var app = angular.module("Contacts", ["ngResource"]);

    app.config(function($routeProvider, $locationProvider) {
      $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);
      $routeProvider
        .when("/contacts", { templateUrl: "<%= asset_path('contacts/index.html') %> ", controller: "ContactsIndexCtrl" })
        .when("/contacts/new", { templateUrl: "<%= asset_path('contacts/edit.html') %> ", controller: "ContactsEditCtrl" })
        .when("/contacts/:id", { templateUrl: "<%= asset_path('contacts/show.html') %> ", controller: "ContactsShowCtrl" })
        .when("/contacts/:id/edit", { templateUrl: "<%= asset_path('contacts/edit.html') %> ", controller: "ContactsEditCtrl" })
        .otherwise({ redirectTo: "/contacts" });
    });

We set the `$locationProvider` to use the HTML5 mode and define our client-side routes for listing, showing, editing and creating new contacts.

### Discussion
Rails is quite a nice environment for your Angular.js app since it can serve the REST API and handle all the asset management easily while keeping best practices in mind.

Let us have a look into the route definition again. First of all the filename ends with `erb`, since it uses ERB tags in the javascript file, courtesy of the Rails [Asset Pipeline](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html). The  `asset_path` method is used to retrieve the URL to the HTML partials since it will change depending on the environment. On production the filename contains an MD5 checksum and the actual ERB output will change from `/assets/contacts/index.html` to `/assets/contacts/index-7ce113b9081a20d93a4a86
e1aacce05f.html`. If your Rails app is configured to use an asset host the path will be in fact absolute.

## Validating Forms Server-Side

### Problem
You want to validate forms using a server-side REST API provided by Rails.

### Solution
Rails already provides model validation support out of the box for us. Let us start with the Contact ActiveRecord model.

    class Contact < ActiveRecord::Base
      attr_accessible :age, :firstname, :lastname

      validates :age, :numericality => { :only_integer => true, :less_than_or_equal_to => 50 }
    end

It defines a validation on the `age` attribute. It must be an integer and less or equal to 50 years.

In the `ContactsController` we can use that to make sure the REST API returns proper error messages. As an example we look into the `create` action.

    class ContactsController < ApplicationController
      respond_to :json

      def create
        @contact = Contact.new(params[:contact])
        if @contact.save
          render json: @contact, status: :created, location: @contact
        else
          render json: @contact.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
        end
      end

    end

On success it will render the contact model using a JSON presentation and on failure it will return all validation errors transformed to JSON.

Our Angular.js contact `$resource` calls the create function and passes the failure callback function.

    Contact.create($scope.contact, success, failure);

    function failure(response) {
      _.each(response.data, function(errors, key) {
        _.each(errors, function(e) {
          $scope.form[key].$dirty = true;
          $scope.form[key].$setValidity(e, false);
        });
      });
    }

The `failure` function iterates through each validation entry and each error and uses `$setValidity` and `$dirty` to mark the form fields as invalid.

Now we are ready to show some feedback to our users using the same approach discussed already in the forms chapter.

    <div class="control-group" ng-class="errorClass('age')">
      <label class="control-label" for="age">Age</label>
      <div class="controls">
        <input ng-model="contact.age" type="text" name="age" placeholder="Age" required>
        <span class="help-block" ng-show="form.age.$invalid && form.age.$dirty">
          {{errorMessage('age')}}
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>

The `errorClass` function adds the `error` CSS class if the form field is invalid and dirty. This will render the label, input field and the help block with a red color.

    $scope.errorClass = function(name) {
      var s = $scope.form[name];
      return s.$invalid && s.$dirty ? "error" : "";
    };

The `errorMessage` will print a more detailed error message and is defined in the same controller.

    $scope.errorMessage = function(name) {
      result = [];
      _.each($scope.form[name].$error, function(key, value) {
        result.push(value);
      });
      return result.join(", ");
    };

It iterates over each error message and creates a comma separated String out of it.

### Discussion
Let us have a look at an example JSON response in order to understand the `failure` callback of the Contact model:

    { "age": ["must be less than or equal to 50"] }

It is a hash with an entry for each attribute with validation errors. The value is an array of Strings since there might be multiple errors at the same time. In the failure function we iterate through these errors and set the dirty flag and the validity.

Lastly, the `errorMessage` handling is of course pretty primitive. A user would expect a localized failure message instead of this technical presentation. The Rails [Internationalization Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html#translations-for-active-record-models) describes how to translate validation error messages in Rails and might prove helpful to further use that in your client-side code.
